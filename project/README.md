#Vision
Our team seeks to create a straightforward webpage that tracks user input such as mouse location and keystrokes. User input would be crowdsourced to create pattern visualizations and generative art. The webpage would display images and instructions that invite the visitor to interact with their screens differently according to their personal traits and attributes. The position of their mouse clicks would be saved to the Mongo database anonymously, thus creating a digital profile of how the user responded to the website’s prompts.
After the user finished clicking through the images, they would be able to review the images, this time displaying points where previous users had clicked, thus gaining a visual insight into the demographic makeup of the previous users. This website wouldn’t necessarily solve a problem or address a need, but could be a delight to play with and see many other users’ interactions, and thus, their identities.
